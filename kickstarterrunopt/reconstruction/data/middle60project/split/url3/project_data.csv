33621704,Godless Patriots: American. Atheist. Shirts.,"&quot;The biggest goal of my mission is to promote a positive societal view of non-theists by providing shirts with a cohesive message to motivated people who would be willing to represent the non-theistic community. In the interest of putting my time where my mouth is: THE FIRST FIVE (AUSTIN-ONLY) DONORS OF $100 OR MORE WILL RECEIVE TWO HOURS OF MY PERSONAL TIME FOR DISCUSSION AND PUBLIC SERVICE. This is how it works: $100 donors will receive two-hours of my time on any weekend in Jan or Feb (to be discussed as soon as the Kickstarter Campaign ends). They may use up to 1 of these hours to have me attend a public, religious function (a service, discussion, or social gathering) in hopes of making myself available as an atheist to respectfully take questions and, more importantly, for me to hear their message (no proselytizing, please). The remaining time (up to 2 hours) will be dedicated to myself (and perhaps a few friends) performing public service in the name of any institution who chooses to support this option. This could be a church-sponsored service project (manual labor, soup kitchens, etc. no protests, please) or I will donate my time to a local cause in the name of your church/institution if you don&#39;t have any events during this time. Keep in mind that this pledge entitles you to at least 2 hours of my time. If I feel comfortable and supportive of your service project, I will gladly stick around for as long as I can afford to. THIS REWARD PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE CURIOUS ABOUT ATHEISM TO TALK TO ME DIRECTLY. I WILL ALSO USE MY TIME TO PERFORM COMMUNITY SERVICE IN THE NAME OF YOUR INSTITUTION. While I would prefer to wear one of my designs while dedicating these two hours of my time, I could be convinced to leave my GP shirts at home (though I will be wearing a button).&quot;",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/godlesspatriots/godless-patriots-american-atheist-shirts?ref=category_newest,"$2,113",45 backers,Steven J.
