1149323710,Sword of Fargoal 2: Classic Dungeon-Crawler Adventure,"&quot;“EPIC HERO” LEVEL. There can be only one Epic Hero backer — just like there can be only one Sword of Fargoal. And if you pledge at this level, the real-life Sword will be yours. That’s right, an actual broadsword with semi-precious stones in the hilt, designed just for this campaign, will be bestowed upon you by Jeff McCord himself in person. Jeff will also make a personal appearance at dinner, a convention, or other event of your choosing in the USA (travel extra). In addition to the one-and-only true Sword of Fargoal, you’ll receive Producer credit in all versions of the game, the orginal artwork of the Fargoal poster, an extremely rare autographed boxed version of the original C64 Sword of Fargoal game. Plus an actual vintage Commodore 64 (C64) computer, 1541 disk drive, and monitor! If you’re our Epic Hero backer, you will also get a 30 minute Skype call with Jeff and Paul, a custom portrait of YOU as a hero drawn by Charlie Canfield, and one of the songs in the official Sword of Fargoal 2 soundtrack will be named after you. You’ll also work directly with Jeff &amp; Paul to come up with a name and description of a new monster, treasure, or weapon in the game. You’ll get the rare mini Sword of Fargoal letter opener. And of course you’ll get all the Associate Producer perks: a printed retro-style Sword of Fargoal poster, a limited-edition print of the game artwork, a lavishly-bound print version of the Sword of Fargoal game book. Plus you’ll get beta access, the Sword of Fargoal 2 game (both the iOS Universal version for iPad and iPhone AND the desktop version for Mac/PC/Linux), the Sword of Fargoal 2 soundtrack, the exclusive Fargoal 2 wallpaper, a SoF2 T-shirt, and access to the backer-only forum. You basically get it all. Plus our undying gratitude.&quot;",https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fargoal/sword-of-fargoal-2-classic-dungeon-crawler-adventu?ref=category_newest,"$50,161","1,163 backers","Fargoal, LLC",http://fargoal.com/http://twitter.com/fargoalhttp://facebook.com/fargoalhttp://kickingitforward.org/,0,"
